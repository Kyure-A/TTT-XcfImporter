* TTT-XcfImporter
An experimental package for importing [[https://www.gimp.org/][GIMP]]'s native image format, XCF, in a manner similar to the [[https://ttt.rs64.net/en/docs/Reference/TexTransToolPSDImporter][TexTransTool PSD Importer]].

** Supported / Not Supported (current state)
- Supported: RGB/RGBA 8-bit layers (XCF v11 and earlier), layer name/visibility/opacity (including FloatOpacity), alpha lock, layer offsets, and a subset of blend modes. Layers are placed on the canvas with their offsets and raw RGBA pixels.
- Not supported: Grayscale/Indexed or >8-bit images; layer folders/groups (all layers are imported flat); layer masks, paths, text or other special layers/parasites; unsupported GIMP blend modes (fallback to Normal); exotic compression outside the usual tiled RLE.
